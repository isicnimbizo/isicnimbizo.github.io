Computational neuroscience is a rapidly expanding subject focussed on understanding and modeling the brain, while helping to designing and interprete future experiments. This school aims to promote computational neuroscience in Africa by bringing together international and local students under the tutelage of world-leading experts in the field.

The format of the school will be a combination of intensive lectures on advanced topics in computational and theoretical neuroscience as well as practical exercises in simulation and data analysis. In addition, students will perform a mini-research project under the supervision of one of the school tutors, to be presented at the end of the school.
