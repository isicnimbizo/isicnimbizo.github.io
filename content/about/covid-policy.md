As is the nature of COVID19, regulations within each country change all the time, sometimes with short notice. The onus is on the attendee to ensure that they have all the correct passport, health and visa requirements as required by their home country and South Africa.

All information we provide is subject to change at a moment’s notice. Please check again a week before your departure if anything has changed. For information on health, passport, visa requirements, the passenger can check on [www.traveldoc.aero](www.traveldoc.aero) or [https://www.joinsherpa.com/](https://www.joinsherpa.com/ "https://www.joinsherpa.com/") or the airline website or the relevant country’s government website.

_Imbizo policy revised in line with new SA Government regulations as of 22 June_

### FOR ALL ATTENDEES:

All Students, Teacher’s Assistants (TAs) and Faculty will be required to be fully vaccinated; proof of vaccination card is required at the time of accepting your place in the school. If vaccines are not available in your home country please contact us to discuss this further isicn.imbizo.planning@gmail.com

Anyone who feels unwell, at any time, must notify the organisers immediately so the necessary precautions can be followed and preparations made.

Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be required to isolate immediately (cost covered by the school).

All Students, TAs and Faculty will be required to adhere to South African COVID-19 laws and regulations. We encourage social distancing and sanitizing or washing of hands at regular intervals. The compulsory wearing of face masks indoors in a public space is no longer a regulation by law (as of 22 June) however if you would like to still wear a mask we support your right to do so.

All Students, TAs and Faculty will be required to have their own fully comprehensive medical insurance that covers all medical costs including COVID-19-related costs (doctors visits, hospitalisation, ambulance transport, ICU, medicines, etc.). It is the attendees’ responsibility to ensure the policy fully covers them whilst attending a conference in South Africa.

Please be advised that all lectures and some meals will take place in a shared space and often indoors.

The Imbizo may cover the cost of one COVID-19 test for any attendee who requires a test prior to flying back to their home country. Please discuss your needs with the Imbizo Team.

### STUDENT AND TA POLICY

Should any Student or TA who has accepted a place at the isiCNI2022 be unable to travel due to revised travel restrictions to South Africa before the summer school starts, their place will be deferred to 2023.

Students and TAs will be accommodated in shared bedrooms, sometimes with 3–4 other students.

Students and TAs will be responsible for their own quarantine and COVID-19 test costs on arrival back in their home country.

### FACULTY POLICY

Faculty will be responsible for their own quarantine and COVID-19 test costs on arrival back in their home country.

Faculty will be accommodated in private rooms within a shared Guesthouse house paid for by the Imbizo. Should you wish to travel with your family or have your own private accommodation we can assist with these arrangements but any additional costs will be for your own account.
