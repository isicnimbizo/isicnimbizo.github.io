As is the nature of COVID19, regulations within each country change all the time, sometimes with short notice. The onus is on the attendee to ensure that they have all the correct passport, health and visa requirements as required by their home country and South Africa.

All information we provide is subject to change at a moment’s notice. Please check again a week before your departure if anything has changed. For information on health, passport, visa requirements, the passenger can check on [www.traveldoc.aero](www.traveldoc.aero) or [https://www.joinsherpa.com/](https://www.joinsherpa.com/ "https://www.joinsherpa.com/") or the airline website or the relevant country’s government website.

### ONSITE COVID POLICY FOR ALL ATTENDEES:

# IMBIZO 2023 Covid Policy

Spending time together and sharing meals are central to the Imbizo experience. However, these close interactions also increase the risk of rapid COVID-19 transmission among attendees. To protect our small community and prevent an outbreak, we will be taking additional precautions to ensure the comfort and safety of all attendees:

### Before arriving in Cape Town

All attendees are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and send their certificates to Emma ([isicn.imbizo.planning@gmail.com](mailto:isicn.imbizo.planning@gmail.com)) prior to arrival. Please do this asap if you have not sent these documents on

We strongly encourage all attendees to get a booster vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to arrival at Imbizo **(28 March).**

### Rules for new arrivals

(applies to all attendees within the first **4 days** upon arrival at the Imbizo)

1. Everyone is strongly encouraged to wear a mask at all times unless eating, drinking or socially distanced outside.
2. Every attendee is requested to test using Imbizo antigen tests on **day 1** and **day 4** upon arrival. Test to be taken in private, and a photo of the test result sent to Emma.

### If tested **positive** for COVID-19

The attendees who test positive will be isolated from the Imbizo activities for **5 days** (5 x 24 hours from the moment they **tested positive**). After 5 days, if the person is asymptomatic and tested negative with an antigen test, they are permitted to join the Imbizo again. If their test on day 5 is still positive **or** symptoms persist: a further 2 days of isolation are required (48 hours).

### During the Imbizo (including the first 4 days)

Anyone who feels unwell, at any time, must notify the organisers immediately so the necessary precautions can be followed and preparations made. If you have **any** COVID-like symptoms (especially runny nose, sore throat, cough, fever, loss of smell or taste), you will be required to take a **test immediately**.

**Additional measures:**

1. Wearing masks is encouraged at all times unless eating, drinking or socially distanced outside
2. The rooms at the Team house will be frequently ventilated, weather permitting. Please do not close windows and doors in communal areas and bedrooms
3. Hand sanitisers will be available at the Team House
