All participants, volunteers, organisers, reviewers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers of the Imbizo (referred to as “participants” collectively from here on) must abide by the following Code of Conduct for the entirety of their involvement with the Imbizo, and on official communication channels, including social media.

Our sponsors are equally subject to this Code of Conduct. In particular, we expect our sponsors to not use images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature. This code applies both to official sponsors as well as any organisation that uses or mentions the Conference name. 

### PURPOSE

* Scientific misconduct, such as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism of papers, code,  research presentation or scientific figures.
* Harassment, bullying, discrimination such as offensive comments related to age, race, religion, creed, color, gender (including transgender/gender identity), sexual orientation, medical condition, physical or intellectual disability, pregnancy, or medical conditions, national origin or ancestry.

* Intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, unnecessary disruption of talks or other Imbizo events.

* “Zoom bombing” or any virtual activity that is not related to the topic of discussion which detracts from the topic or the purpose of the program. This includes inappropriate remarks in chat areas.

Any issues brought to the attention of the Organisers will be taken seriously, and the organisers reserve the right to reprimand or even exclude any participant for breach of this code of conduct. 

The Imbizo will not actively monitor social media platforms but will follow up on issues of harassment and violations of the code of conduct that occur on those platforms that are specifically related to the Imbizo program, during the course of Imbizo, if and when they are brought to our attention.

### COMPLAINT REPORTING
