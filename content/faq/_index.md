## {{<icon "ti-info">}}  General {.project-meta}

**What is Computational Neuroscience?**

Computational neuroscience is a rapidly expanding subject focused on understanding and modeling the brain, while helping to design and interpret future experiments. This school aims to promote computational neuroscience in Africa by bringing together international and local students under the tutelage of world-leading experts in the field.

### {{<icon "ti-info">}}  **What is Imbizo?** {.faq-item}

Imbizo is a Xhosa word meaning “a gathering to share knowledge”. The IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo, or isiCNI is exactly that: an opportunity for African and international students to learn about cutting edge research techniques in computational neuroscience

**How long has Imbizo been running?**

The first Imbizo was held in January 2017 in Muizenberg, Cape Town.

2023 will be the 6th Imbizo, as the 2021 Imbizo was postponed during the COVID19 global shutdown.

**Who should apply?**

The school is aimed at students who are completing their masters or beginning their doctoral studies, though well motivated and advanced undergraduates or postdoctoral students should also apply. Students should have a good quantitative background: e.g. 2nd year university level experience in physics, engineering, statistics or computer science, etc. Experimental neuroscientists with some quantitative/coding experience who think the imbizo will strengthen these skills should also apply. All students should have some experience writing code.

**What level of students can apply?**

MSc Physics student

Has a bachelors in physical sciences (e.g. physics / statistics / mathematics / computer science). Has taken 1st-year level courses in biology / electives in psychology, etc.

PhD Neuroscience candidate

Has a bachelors in biological science, has completed 2nd-year level courses in statistics / applied mathematics / bioinformatics. Now in Masters/PhD. Has some experience writing code.

Post-doctoral researcher in Machine Learning

This school will be most beneficial for postgraduate students and postdocs who want to fast track their education in the quantitative aspects of neuroscience.

**When is Imbizo 2023?**

Arrival day Wednesday 12 April

Imbizo Thursday 13 April to Saturday 6 May

Departure day Sunday 7 May

**Where does Imbizo take place?**

Noordhoek, Cape Town, South Africa
