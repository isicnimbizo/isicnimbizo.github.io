  - question: What is Computational Neuroscience?
    icon: fa-solid fa-brain
    answer: Computational neuroscience is a rapidly expanding subject focussed on
      understanding and modeling the brain, while helping to design and interpret
      future experiments. This school aims to promote computational neuroscience in
      Africa by bringing together international and local students under the tutelage
      of world-leading experts in the field.
  - question: What is Imbizo?
    icon: fa-solid fa-fire
    answer: 'Imbizo is a Xhosa word meaning “a gathering to share knowledge”. The
      IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo, or isiCNI is exactly that: an
      opportunity for African and international students to learn about cutting edge
      research techniques in computational neuroscience           '
  - question: How long has Imbizo been running?
    icon: fa-solid fa-arrow-trend-up
    answer: "The first Imbizo was held in January 2017 in Muizenberg, Cape Town.\n2023

      own ’social energy’ quota and as such understand that some personal time is
      very important too. Whether on the beach or in your shared room, there will
      be moments for reflection. We do expect, however, for you to engage in the planned
      social activities which occur 3-4 times per week \n\nBy applying, you commit
      to twenty-five subsequent days of intense science, socialising, and fun."

  title: Travel, visas, accommodation, and food
  item:
  - question: Who books my flight to Cape Town?
    icon: fa-solid fa-plane
    answer: For students who are awarded a full scholarship Imbizo will book and pay
      for your economy travel to Cape Town. All other students are required to book,
      manage and pay for  their own travel themselves.  For students booking their
      own travel we suggest booking flights early as availability to Cape Town can
      be limited. Students booking their own travel will be required to send a copy
      of their e-ticket to Imbizo Committee no less than 8 weeks prior to arrival
      in Cape Town
  - question: What about visas?
    icon: fa-solid fa-passport
    answer: |-
      The Imbizo acknowledges that a visa can be a tricky process and we will provide supporting documents to make the process easier where we can. The documents we can provide are only:
      - Invitation letter (incl. scholarship award if applicable)
      - Proof of accommodation
      - Flight itinerary (not a purchased flight - flight only booked upon visa confirmation)

      **Be aware that a visa can take a few months to apply for and receive - apply as soon as you are accepted**

      Imbizo is not a visa or travel agency and does not have connections with SA Embassies in the various countries.  Responsibility remains on the student to find out their  individual visa requirements by contacting the SA Embassy in the country they live in.  Students must keep the Imbizo Committee up to date of the status of their visa application at all times.

      Imbizo is aware that some countries are part of the new ‘still in test stage’  e-visa program rolled out by the SA Dept Home Affairs.  Unfortunately this system ***does not work***, and we must request that all students apply in person at the SA Embassy in the country they live in.
  - question: What kind of food will we eat?
    icon: fa-solid fa-utensils
    answer: Delicious and nutritious food will be served daily for breakfast, lunch
      and dinner. On lecture days tea and coffee break will also include treats and
      snacks to keep you going to the next meal.  24 hour access to all important
      tea and coffee will also be provided for.  We are able to provide for vegetarian
      dietary requirements only.  Should you have any food allergies please let us
      know and we will provide suitable alternatives where applicable

      of the bedrooms are ensuite but two rooms make use of a general shared bathroom
      in the corridor.   Bedding and towels are provided by the venue. Please bring
