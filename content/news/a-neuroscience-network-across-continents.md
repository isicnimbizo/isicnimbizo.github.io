> A gathering to share knowledge”: Imbizo’s founders chose this Xhosa word to name their computational neuroscience summer school in South Africa and the African continent. Since co-founding Imbizo in 2016, Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) Professor Tim Vogels has attracted bright minds to both Imbizo and ISTA. Four Imbizo alumni with ties to ISTA tell how their unique experience led them to be at the core of an intercontinental neuroscience network.

> In January 2025, a new group of promising young researchers from across Africa and the world will gather in the southern summer by the beach near Cape Town to share knowledge at another ‘imbizo’. “Imbizo will continue to bring together bright young minds from Africa and beyond, connect them for life, and allow them to sail to new horizons, inspiring others along their way,” concludes Vogels who stepped down from his function as Imbizo President in 2024 but remains on the summer school’s organizing board.
