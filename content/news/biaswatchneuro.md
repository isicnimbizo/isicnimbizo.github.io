> This year, we announced a new annual recognition for neuroscience or neuroscience-related departments, institutes and programs that demonstrate the exceptional creation of a culture where individuals underrepresented and/or marginalized in STEM feel integral to the community and thrive.

...

> Two other nominations that we’d like to recognize with honorable mentions are **NeuroMatch Academy (NMA)** and the **IBRO-SIMONS Computational Neuroscience Imbizo**. These summer schools did not fall under this year’s call for nominations, which was intended for programs that support long-term training and research, however, their contribution to increasing diversity in neuroscience is commendable.
