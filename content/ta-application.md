We are looking for teaching assistants for the Computational Neuroscience Imbizo (#Imbizo), a computational neuroscience summer school held in Cape Town, South Africa.

We are looking for post-doctoral or advanced PhD researchers to join our team as Teaching Assistants (TAs) for the #Imbizo2022 in August 2022.  Please send your application to [isicn.imbizo@gmail.com](mailto:isicn.imbizo@gmail.com "isicn.imbizo@gmail.com"). Include 1) CV and a 2) cover letter with a short motivational statement for why you would be a good fit, and what your favourite topics would be for teaching tutorials and supervising student projects. Additionally, 3) please provide the email address of one reference.

**We will start assessing applications on 11 October 2021.**

**About the Imbizo:**

The school hosts 31 students for an amazing 25 days of lectures, tutorials, projects and parties. All this takes place on Noordhoek beach, between the mountain and the ocean. It's a spectacular location. The dates for the Imbizo2022 are August 11th to September 4th 2022.

The Imbizo is a special experience, with students being totally immersed in academic, social, touristic and cultural activities, and has resulted in student and TA groups from previous schools becoming very close, personally and scientifically. This is fantastic, as a major goal of the Imbizo project is to help young African researchers grow their academic peer and friend group.

**About being a TA:**

Each TA runs one afternoon tutorial in the first week of the school, which they design themselves.

Each TA will teach a different topic, which the TA's choose among themselves, to provide students with a broad exposure to problems and methods in computational neuroscience.

Each TA is also assigned 5 students to supervise for project work during the last 2 weeks of the school.

TAs will be asked to help process student applications.

**TAs are integral in helping run the school**_._ In addition to academic support, they foster good social interactions and academic discussions among students, and they help 'shy' students meet faculty. They also act as 'social glue’, helping to notice and support students who may be feeling ill, not fitting in socially, or generally having difficulties.

To fulfil these roles, TAs need to be at all school meals and activities.

**What we provide:**

We cover a direct-as-possible, economy class ticket to Cape Town, as well as all board and lodging during the school.

In addition, TAs will receive a cash budget for 'hosting purposes' during the school (e.g. for buying some beverages/ice-creams for students, train tickets, etc.). We also provide you with life-long memories of one of the most beautiful places on earth.

**I'm interested, how do I apply:**

If you think you would like to join us for this amazing experience, please send us a brief CV (2 or 3 pages is fine) to [isicn.imbizo@gmail.com](mailto:isicn.imbizo@gmail.com "isicn.imbizo@gmail.com"). Please include (as a cover letter or in your email) a short motivational statement for why you would be a good fit, and what your favourite topics would be for teaching tutorials and supervising student projects.

**We will start assessing applications on 11 October 2021.**

A call for student application will follow soon. We hope to hear from you soon! Let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks and regards
