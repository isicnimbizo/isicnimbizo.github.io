  title: Who should apply?
  content: 'The school is designed for students who are completing their masterâ€™s degrees or starting their doctoral studies. However, highly motivated advanced undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers are also encouraged to apply. We welcome applicants with a good quantitative background, such as at least two years of university-level experience in fields like physics, engineering, statistics, computer science, or related disciplines. Experimental neuroscientists or medical doctors with some coding or quantitative experience who want to strengthen these skills are also encouraged to apply. All applicants should have some prior experience with coding.'
