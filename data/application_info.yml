  title: Who should apply?
  content: 'The school is aimed at students who are completing their masters or beginning
    their doctoral studies, though well-motivated and advanced undergraduates or postdoctoral
    students should also apply. Students should have a good quantitative background:
    e.g., 2nd year university-level experience in physics, engineering, statistics
    or computer science, etc. Experimental neuroscientists with some quantitative/coding
    experience who think the imbizo with strengthen these skills should also apply.
    All students should have some experience writing code.'
  preamble: Example backgrounds
  item:
  - title: MSc Physics student
    icon: images/icons/icon-1.png
    content: Has a bachelors in physical sciences (e.g., physics / statistics / mathematics
      / computer science). Has taken 1st-year level courses in biology / electives
      in psychology, etc.
  - title: PhD Neuroscience candidate
    icon: images/icons/icon-2.png
    content: Has a bachelors in biological science, has completed 2nd-year level courses
      in statistics / applied mathematics / bioinformatics. Now in Masters/PhD. Has
      some experience writing code.
  - title: Post-doctoral researcher in Machine Learning
    icon: images/icons/icon-3.png
    content: This school will be most beneficial for postgraduate students and postdocs
      who want to fast-track their education in the quantitative aspects of neuroscience.
      If you already have a strong background in Computational Neuroscience or Machine
      Learning, perhaps you would be better suited as a Teaching Assistant?

  title: Frequently asked questions
  gapsize: 5
  item:
  - question: What is computational neuroscience?
    answer: Computational neuroscience is a rapidly expanding subject focussed on
      understanding and modeling the brain, while helping to design and interpret
      future experiments. This school aims to promote computational neuroscience in
      Africa by bringing together international and local students under the tutelage
      of world-leading experts in the field.
  - question: I am very introverted and the Imbizo is an intensive social experience,
      will I cope?
    answer: The social interactions and community ethos define the Imbizo (it's in
      the name!), so isolating yourself the entire time will not work. Having said
      that, we all have our own "social energy" quota and as such understand that
      some personal time is important, too. Whether on the beach or in your room, there
      will be moments for reflection. We do expect, however, for you to engage in
      the planned social activities which occur 3-4 times per week.
  - question: I'm not sure if I'm a good fit for the school, should I still apply?
    answer: |-
      **Yes!** Give yourself every opportunity to succeed by applying in the first place and getting good references about your character.

      The Imbizo is an opportunity to grow, explore, and learn new things while meeting amazing people along the way. Diverse backgrounds complement the experience and benefit the group dynamics; each participant will have their own journey to share.
  - question: I am a resident of Cape Town, do I need to pay the full fee?
    answer: Yes, all students will be working hard on their projects and taking part
      in many social activities with each other and the faculty. For this reason,
      all students will be required to stay in the student accommodation, attend all
      meals and activities, etc. This also means costs are essentially the same for
      all students. Note though that bursaries and travel grants will be provided
      to as many students as possible, on a basis of need and merit. In your application,
      specify what financial contribution you can make, and be sure to request financial
      assistance where asked.
