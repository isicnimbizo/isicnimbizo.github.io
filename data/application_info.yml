  title: Who should apply?
  content: 'The school is aimed at students who are either completing their masters or beginning their doctoral studies, although well-motivated advanced undergraduate students or postdoctoral researchers are also encouraged to apply. Students should have a good quantitative background: e.g., 2nd year of university-level experience in physics, engineering, statistics, computer science, etc. Experimental neuroscientists with some quantitative/coding experience who think the Imbizo will help strengthen these skills are also welcome to apply. All students should have some experience writing code.'
  preamble: Example backgrounds
  item:
  - title: MSc Physics student

  - title: PhD Neuroscience candidate
    icon: images/icons/icon-2.png
    content: 'Has a bachelors in biological science, has completed 2nd-year level courses in statistics, applied mathematics, or bioinformatics. Now in Masters/PhD. Has some experience writing code.'
  - title: Post-doctoral researcher in Machine Learning
    icon: images/icons/icon-3.png
    content: 'This school will be most beneficial for postgraduate students and postdocs, who want to fast-track their education in the quantitative aspects of neuroscience. If you already have a strong background in computational neuroscience or machine learning, perhaps you would be better suited as a Teaching Assistant.'
