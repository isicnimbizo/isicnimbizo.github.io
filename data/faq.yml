    - question: What is computational neuroscience?
      answer: Computational neuroscience is a rapidly expanding subject focussed on understanding and modeling the brain while helping to design and interpret future experiments. This school aims to promote computational neuroscience in Africa by bringing together international and local students under the tutelage of world-leading experts in the field.
    - question: I am very introverted and the Imbizo is an intensive social experience, will I cope?
      answer: The social interactions and community ethos define the Imbizo (it is in the name!), so isolating yourself the entire time will not work. Having said that, we all have our own "social energy" quota and, as such, understand that some personal time is important, too. Whether on the beach or in your room, there will be moments for reflection. We do expect, however, for you to engage in the planned social activities, which occur 3-4 times per week.
    - question: I am not sure if I am a good fit for the school, should I still apply?
      answer: **Yes!** Give yourself every opportunity to succeed by applying in the first place and getting good references about your character. The Imbizo is an opportunity to grow, explore, and learn new things while meeting amazing people along the way. Diverse backgrounds complement the experience and benefit the group dynamics; each participant will have their own journey to share.
    - question: I am a resident of Cape Town, do I need to pay the full fee?
