    - question: What is computational neuroscience?
      answer:
        Computational neuroscience is a rapidly expanding subject focussed on
        understanding and modeling the brain, while helping to designing and interpret
        future experiments. This school aims to promote computational neuroscience in
        Africa by bringing together international and local students under the tutelage
        of world-leading experts in the field.
    - question:
        I am very introverted and the Imbizo is an intensive social experience,
        will I cope?
      answer:
        The social interactions and community ethos define the Imbizo (it's in
        the name!), so isolating yourself the entire time will not work. Having said
        that, we all have our own "social energy" quota and as such understand that
        some personal time is important too. Whether on the beach or in your room, there
        will be moments for reflection. We do expect, however, for you to engage in
        the planned social activities which occur 3-4 times per week.
    - question: I'm not sure if I'm a good fit for the school, should I still apply?
      answer: |-
        **Yes!** Give yourself every opportunity to succeed by applying in the first place and getting good references about your character.

        The Imbizo is an opportunity to grow, explore, and learn new things while meeting amazing people along the way. Diverse backgrounds complement the experience and benefit the group dynamics; each participant will have their own journey to share.
    - question: I am a resident of Cape Town, do I need to pay the full fee?
      answer:
        Yes, all students will be working hard on their projects and taking part
        in many social activities with each other and the faculty. For this reason,
        all students will be required to stay in the student accommodation, attend all
        meals and activities etc. This also means costs are essentially the same for
        all students. Note though that bursaries and travel grants will be provided
        to as many students as possible, on a basis of need and merit. In your application,
        specify what financial contribution you can make and be sure to request financial
        assistance where asked.
