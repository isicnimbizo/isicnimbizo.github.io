    _Imbizo_ is a Xhosa word meaning "a gathering to share knowledge". The *IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo*, or _isiCNI_ is exactly that: an opportunity for African and international students to learn about cutting edge research techniques in [computational neuroscience](/apply#faq).

  content: The school will consist of a 5 working day week with 1 day off. Each week
    will be focused on one of the themes appearing below. Your day off will be spent
    exploring some of the beautiful wonders around Cape Town. Each workday will consist
    of lectures in the morning, followed by either further lectures/practical tutorials
    in the afternoons.
  item:
  - title: Biophysics, Plasticity and Neural Recordings
    content: What makes a neurons special? How do we model them mathematically? How
      do we model synapses and why are they important for neural function? These questions
      will guide the first part of week 1 at the Imbizo. We will also learn about
      cutting-edge techniques used for large-scale neural data recording from world
      experts in patch-clamping techniques and from the NEUROPIXEL project.

  - title: Network Dynamics & Machine Learning
    content: The functioning of the brain is ultimately an emergent phenomenon; a
      result of the complex interactions between billions of neurons. In week two
      we will learn how to model and analyse these dynamic networks, and how biological
      trends like Dale's Law make understanding these system more difficult and fascinating.
      We will also learn what the modern field of machine learning can teach us about
      learning in network architectures and how these artificial systems are similar
      and different to biological neural systems.

  - title: Higher Level Function, Motor Control & Decision Making
    faculty: Peter Latham
    content: Week three will try to bridge the gap from what we have learnt about
      the biology and dynamics of brains to what we observe in behaviour. We will
      also explore how the phenomenon of spiking in neural networks makes implementing
      some of the ML algorithms and dynamics from week two a lot more challenging.
      We will also learn about cutting-edge research in brain-computer interfacing
      and what this is revealing about how brains work.
