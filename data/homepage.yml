    '_Imbizo_ is a Xhosa word meaning "a gathering to share knowledge". The
    *IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo*, or _isiCNI_ is exactly that:
    an opportunity for African and international students to learn about cutting edge
    research techniques in [computational neuroscience](/apply#faq).'

    The school will consist of four 5-day work weeks with 1 day off in-between.
    Each week will be focused on one of the themes appearing below. Your day off will
    be spent exploring some of the beautiful wonders around Cape Town. Each workday
    will consist of lectures in the morning, followed by either further lectures/practical
    tutorials in the afternoons.
  item:
    - title: Biophysics, Plasticity and Neural Recordings
      content:
        What makes a neurons special? How do we model them mathematically? How
        do we model synapses and why are they important for neural function? These questions
        will guide the first part of week 1 at the Imbizo. We will also learn about
        cutting-edge techniques used for large-scale neural data recording from world
        experts in patch-clamping techniques and from the NEUROPIXEL project.

    - title: Network Dynamics
      content:
        The functioning of the brain is ultimately an emergent phenomenon; a
        result of the complex interactions between billions of neurons. In week two
        we will learn how to model and analyse these dynamic networks, and how biological
        trends like Dale's Law make understanding these system more difficult and fascinating.

    - title: Machine Learning
      content:
        We will also learn what the modern field of machine learning can teach
        us about learning in network architectures and how these artificial systems
        are similar and different to biological neural systems.

      faculty: Peter Latham
      content:
        The final week will try to bridge the gap from what we have learnt about
        the biology and dynamics of brains to what we observe in behaviour. We will
        also explore how the phenomenon of spiking in neural networks makes implementing
        some of the ML algorithms and dynamics from week two a lot more challenging.
        We will also learn about cutting-edge research in brain-computer interfacing
        and what this is revealing about how brains work.
