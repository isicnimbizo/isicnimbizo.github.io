  content: '_Imbizo_ is a Xhosa word meaning "a gathering to share knowledge". The
    *Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo* is exactly that:
    an opportunity for African and international students to learn about cutting-edge
    research techniques in [computational neuroscience](/faq).'

  content: The school will consist of 3 cycles. 
   Cycle 1, 2, and 3 will consist of 6 working days with 1 day off in between. 
   Each week will be focused on one of the themes appearing below. 
   Your day off will be spent exploring some of the beautiful wonders around Cape Town. 
   Each workday will consist of lectures in the morning, 
   followed by either further lectures/practical tutorials in the afternoons.
  item:
  - title: Biophysics, Plasticity and Neural Recordings
    content: What makes neurons special? How do we model them mathematically? How
      do we model synapses and why are they important for neural function? These questions
      will guide the first part of the Imbizo. We will also learn about
      cutting-edge techniques used for large-scale neural data recording from world
      experts in patch-clamping techniques and from the NEUROPIXEL project.

  - title: Network Dynamics
    content: The functioning of the brain is ultimately an emergent phenomenon; a
      result of the complex interactions between billions of neurons. We will learn how to model and analyse these dynamic networks, and how biological
      trends like Dale's Law make understanding these systems more difficult and fascinating.

  - title: Higher Level Function, Motor Control & Decision Making
    faculty: Peter Latham
    content: This cycle will try to bridge the gap from what we have learned about
      the biology and dynamics of brains to what we observe in behaviour.
      We will also learn about cutting-edge research in brain-computer interfacing
      and what this is revealing about how brains work.

  - title: Machine Learning
    content: 'Biological and artificial systems have at least three things in common: 1) They sense "the world", 
    2) turn data from the senses into representations, 3) useful for accomplishing tasks/goals. 
    This week will explore guiding principles for how to design modern artificial systems (neural networks, machine learning algorithms), 
    with an emphasis on how biological/biophysical principles can inform this process.'
