  content: '_Imbizo_ is a Xhosa word meaning "a gathering to share knowledge". The
    *IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo*, or _isiCNI_ is exactly that:
    an opportunity for African and international students to learn about cutting edge
    research techniques in [computational neuroscience](/faq).'

  content: The school will consist of four 5-day work weeks with 1 day off in-between.
    Each week will be focused on one of the themes appearing below. Your day off will
    be spent exploring some of the beautiful wonders around Cape Town. Each workday
    will consist of lectures in the morning, followed by either further lectures/practical
    tutorials in the afternoons.
  item:
  - title: Biophysics, Plasticity and Neural Recordings
    content: What makes a neurons special? How do we model them mathematically? How
      do we model synapses and why are they important for neural function? These questions
      will guide the first part of the Imbizo. We will also learn about
      cutting-edge techniques used for large-scale neural data recording from world
      experts in patch-clamping techniques and from the NEUROPIXEL project.

  - title: Network Dynamics
    content: The functioning of the brain is ultimately an emergent phenomenon; a
      result of the complex interactions between billions of neurons. We will learn how to model and analyse these dynamic networks, and how biological
      trends like Dale's Law make understanding these system more difficult and fascinating.

  - title: Higher Level Function, Motor Control & Decision Making
    faculty: Peter Latham
    content: This cycle will try to bridge the gap from what we have learnt about
      the biology and dynamics of brains to what we observe in behaviour.
      We will also learn about cutting-edge research in brain-computer interfacing
      and what this is revealing about how brains work.

  - title: Machine Learning
    content: We will also learn what the modern field of machine learning can teach
      us about learning in network architectures and how these artificial systems
      are similar and different to biological neural systems.
