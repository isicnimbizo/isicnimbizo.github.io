&lt;p>A gathering to share knowledge”: Imbizo’s founders chose this Xhosa word to name their computational neuroscience summer school in South Africa and the African continent. Since co-founding Imbizo in 2016, Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) Professor Tim Vogels has attracted bright minds to both Imbizo and ISTA. Four Imbizo alumni with ties to ISTA tell how their unique experience led them to be at the core of an intercontinental neuroscience network.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call for Teaching Assistants for the Cape Town Imbizo</title><link>/ta-application/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ta-application/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are looking for teaching assistants for the Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo, a computational neuroscience summer school held in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024</title><link>/archive/2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/archive/2024/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Simons Trust Imbizo Follow Up Grant</title><link>/apply/stifug/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/apply/stifug/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>STIFUG awards are supported by the Simons Foundation&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
